# Password-Generator 

The goal of this challenge/project was to create a password generator.

1. The point of this project was to create a password generator that generates random characters.

2. When you click Generate Password, there are a series of prompts and alerts that ask if you want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols, and to choose a number between 8-128.
  
3. After the user selects 'Ok' to the prompts, the generator will create a randomized password with some or all of the characters.
